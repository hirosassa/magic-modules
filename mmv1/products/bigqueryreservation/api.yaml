          TRIAL: Trial commitments have a committed period of 182 days after becoming ACTIVE. After that, they are converted to a new commitment based on the renewalPlan. Default renewalPlan for Trial commitment is Flex so that it can be deleted right after committed period ends.
          MONTHLY: Monthly commitments have a committed period of 30 days after becoming ACTIVE. After that, they are not in a committed period anymore and can be removed any time.
          ANNUAL: Annual commitments have a committed period of 365 days after becoming ACTIVE. After that they are converted to a new commitment based on the renewalPlan.
